## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to collect the names and types of common pipeline stages and steps.

If you are looking for the terminology used by various CI/CD tools,
please consult [the tools terminology](./tools-terminology.md) document
which is located next to this document.

## Pipeline Terminology

### Pipeline Stages

The list below is an attempt to create a mapping of common names for Stages, where a Stage is defined here as the unit of work one degree smaller than a Pipeline. (The effort of proposing a common vocabulary across CI/CD Tools and Technologies is not yet performed, but we'll use the most common term from the table above as the working term.)

While CI/CD Tools and Technologies generally give developers broad leeway in naming and implementing their Stages, agreeing upon some common terms will help develop more pluggable Pipelines.

The concepts below can be re-ordered in Pipeline implementations. For example, it is often the case that software linting (logically a test) is done prior to the Build Stage. Also, deployment to a staging environment is often done prior to the Release Stage, while the deployment for production often happens after the Release Stage.

In Pipeline implementations, there may also be other Stages preceding or following the ones listed below.

In the lists and table below, Software Artifacts includes: Documentation Source Files, Source Code, Baseline/Composition/Dependency Information, Infrastructure as Code.

"Software Source" refers to human-readable source files that are inputs to the pipeline, such as: Source Code, Configuration Files, Documentation Source Files, Declared Dependencies, Baseline/Composition Information (i.e. lock files in source control)

"Binary Source" refers to executables that are inputs to the pipeline, such as: Executable Software Dependencies, Container Images, Virtual Machine Images

"Generated Software" refers to human-readable files that are outputs of the pipeline, such as: Compiled Software, Generated Configuration Files, Compiled Documentation, Baseline/Composition Information generated by the pipeline.

"Generated Binaries" refers to executables that are outputs of the pipeline, such as: Executable Software, Container Images, Virtual Machine Images

#### Any Stage

* Semantics: Some inputs and outputs are used across any and all stages. They're listed here once, rather than repeating them for each stage.
* Aliases: N/A
* Inputs: Secrets, Pipeline Environment, Pipeline Workspace, Pipeline Utility Tools
* Outputs: Stage Results and Return Codes, Logs

#### Build Stage

* Semantics: Download, retrieve, assemble, and/or compile software into an executable and testable format. Download, retrieve, assemble, and/or compile documentation into a consumable format.
* Aliases: Compile
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source
* Outputs: Generated Software, Generated Binaries
* Other Results and Side Effects: The Build stage may also capture and store point-in-time details about the pipeline environment and tools (compiler versions, package manager versions, task container versions in tekton, OS versions etc.). While the pipeline configuration should ideally be in source code, in reality some settings will likely depend on external factors. Storing this information in an immutable data store facilitates debugging, rebuilds, pipeline verification, audit records, and forensics. 

#### Test Stage

* Semantics: Test, scan, verify, and lint software and documentation.
* Aliases: Verify
* Inputs: Software Source, Binary Source, Generated Software, Generated Binaries

### Pipeline Step Types

The table below is an attempt to create a mapping of common names for the various types of Pipeline Steps (the unit of work two degrees smaller than a Pipeline). (The effort of proposing a common vocabulary across CI/CD Tools and Technologies is not yet performed, but we'll use the most common term from the table above as the working term.)

While CI/CD tools and technologies generally give developers broad leeway in naming and implementing their Pipeline Steps, agreeing upon some common terms will help develop more pluggable pipelines. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Each type of Pipeline Step will generally have several implementations that are tool specific. For example, Source will have implementations for various Source Code Management (SCM) tools. Publish will have implementations for each type of repository, and so on.

* Aliases: N/A
* Inputs: Output of previous steps.
* Outputs: Message Return Code / Results
* Other Results and Side Effects: Message sent.

#### Create Request

* Semantics: Create a request in another system; for example, create a Change Request that must be approved for a deployment to production. This is different from "Message" because we need to get a link/reference for the new request, and store it, so we can potentially update it later.

#### Inputs and Outputs for Pipeline Steps

The inputs and outputs listed in this table are the ones that are used by more than one step. These inputs and outputs need to be in a location and/or format that the pipeline steps expect so they can be processed correctly.

With the exception of the Setup and Cleanup steps, all steps have the following inputs: Secrets, Pipeline Environment, Pipeline Workspace, Parameters for the Step; and the following outputs: Return Codes, Results, Records and Reports, Logs.
