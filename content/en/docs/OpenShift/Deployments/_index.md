## What is this?

In this section you will find guides for the various OCP deployment options. These will generally be broken down by environment, and then further organized by deployment method. For more information, check out the options for [Deploying OCP](https://pages.github.ibm.com/BoxBoat-OpenShift-Practice/bop-wiki/docs/technical/openshift-technical-resources/deploying-openshift/) and [OCP Environments](https://pages.github.ibm.com/BoxBoat-OpenShift-Practice/bop-wiki/docs/technical/openshift-technical-resources/openshift-offerings/) from the Wiki.
