### Workshops vs Labs?

#### Workshops

Workshops are meant to be less defined and structured, with little guidance throughout the process - more similar to an enterprise environment. These help to prepare you for real-world usage and to invoke critical thinking about the technologies.

#### Labs

Labs are tutorials and guides, focused on teaching the fundamentals of the target technologies.
