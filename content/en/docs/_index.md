## Welcome

You might be wondering, why should I come here to learn about specific OpenShift features vs the official [OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{{< param "ocp_version" >}}/welcome/index.html)? The answer is, you shouldn't! But things don't have to be either/or in the realm of documentation and blogs!

## Overview

Nothing can replace good documentation. And this site isn't meant to replace anything else. Rather, the goal is for it to subsidize and enhance existing materials available.

In particular, the materials in this site will often focus on the intersection between Red Hat {{< icons/redhat >}} technologies and 3rd parties, such as Tekton Pipelines-as-Code with GitHub Actions or GitLab.
