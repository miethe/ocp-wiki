DisplayPort and HDMI are two popular standards for transmitting video and audio from a player to a display. They have some similarities, but also differ in various aspects, such as supported resolutions, data rates, and use cases. In this write-up, we will cover both standards and their versions, as well as compare and contrast their features, limitations, and ideal use cases.

## DisplayPort

DisplayPort (DP) is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). It was designed primarily for computer displays and professional IT equipment, with the goal of providing high-resolution video and audio.

### Key versions of DisplayPort

* DisplayPort 1.2: Introduced in 2010, this version supports resolutions up to 4K at 60 Hz and has a maximum bandwidth of 17.28 Gbps.
* DisplayPort 1.3: Released in 2014, it supports 8K resolution at 60 Hz and has a maximum bandwidth of 25.92 Gbps.
* DisplayPort 1.4: Launched in 2016, it has the same bandwidth as DP 1.3 but adds support for Display Stream Compression (DSC), enabling 8K at 60 Hz with HDR or 4K at 120 Hz.
* DisplayPort 2.0: Announced in 2019, it significantly increases bandwidth to 77.4 Gbps, allowing for 8K at 60 Hz with HDR and uncompressed 10K at 60 Hz.

## HDMI

High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a digital audio and video interface developed by the HDMI Forum. It is commonly used for consumer electronics like TVs, gaming consoles, and home theater systems.

### Key versions of HDMI

* HDMI 1.4: Introduced in 2009, it supports resolutions up to 4K at 30 Hz and has a maximum bandwidth of 10.2 Gbps.
* HDMI 2.0: Released in 2013, it supports 4K at 60 Hz and has a maximum bandwidth of 14.4 Gbps.
* HDMI 2.1: Launched in 2017, it dramatically increases the bandwidth to 48 Gbps, allowing for 8K at 60 Hz and 4K at 120 Hz with various enhancements like Dynamic HDR and eARC.

## Comparison and Use Cases

DisplayPort is typically better suited for computer displays and professional applications, while HDMI is more common in consumer electronics. Key differences include:

* Resolutions and refresh rates: DisplayPort generally supports higher resolutions and refresh rates compared to HDMI, thanks to its higher bandwidth. For example, DisplayPort 2.0 can support 8K at 60 Hz with HDR and 10K at 60 Hz, while HDMI 2.1 supports 8K at 60 Hz.
* Audio features: HDMI has a slight edge in audio capabilities, as it supports Audio Return Channel (ARC) and Enhanced Audio Return Channel (eARC), which allow for high-quality audio transmission between devices.
* Daisy-chaining: DisplayPort supports Multi-Stream Transport (MST), which enables daisy-chaining of multiple monitors with a single cable. HDMI does not have this feature.
* Adaptive sync: Both DisplayPort and HDMI support adaptive sync technologies like AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync, which help eliminate screen tearing and stuttering in gaming.

In conclusion, DisplayPort is ideal for high-resolution computer displays and professional applications, while HDMI is better suited for consumer electronics and home theater systems. Users should choose the appropriate standard based on their specific needs and the devices they own. It's essential to check the supported versions of DisplayPort and HDMI.
