## Background

I've been looking for a new pair of near-field speakers for my office. Many years ago, I made my first foray into passive bookshelves with a fairly low budget. I landed on a pair of [Micca MB42x](https://www.amazon.com/Micca-MB42X-Bookshelf-Speakers-Tweeter/dp/B00E7H8GG2?th=1) w/ a SMSL SA-50 desktop amp. While certainly nothing special, they served their purpose for nearly a decade, considering I usually preferred [Headphones]({{< ref "/headphones" >}}). However, in my current environment, I find myself using my speakers instead 90% of the time, or more. And as my other audio components, and budget, have improved dramatically, my desktop system was long-ago left in the dust.

## Search Parameters

There are a number of variables to consider when searching for a pair of near-field bookshelf speakers. To start, near-field generally represents a speaker meant to be utilized in close quarters, vs the typical distance of 6+ feet.

* **Frequency Response**: This indicates the range of frequencies a speaker can reproduce. While sub-bass extension wasn't critical for my use case, as I use a separate subwoofer, a balanced frequency response across the rest of the spectrum is essential for accurate sound reproduction. Ideally, one should look for speakers with a relatively flat response within the range of human hearing *(20Hz - 20kHz)*.
* **Sensitivity**: This refers to how efficiently a speaker converts power into sound. Higher sensitivity means the speaker will play louder with less power, which can be beneficial for lower-powered amplifiers. A sensitivity of around *85-90 dB* is generally acceptable for near-field listening.
* **Impedance**: Measured in ohms, impedance is the speaker's resistance to the flow of electrical current. Most speakers have an impedance of *4, 6, or 8 ohms*. It's important to ensure the target amplifier is compatible with the speaker's impedance to avoid overloading or under-powering the speakers.
* **Driver Size/Type**: I preferred a maximum woofer size of *6.5 inches*, a typical max for near-field. But it's also important to consider the driver composition and arrangement as well. Multiple drivers (e.g., tweeter, midrange, woofer) can provide a more detailed and accurate sound reproduction, even with smaller individual driver sizes. Some speakers, like the KEF LS50 Meta, use innovative driver designs (Uni-Q) to improve sound quality.
* **Enclosure**: The speaker's cabinet plays a crucial role in its sound quality. Some designs, like bass-reflex, may deliver better bass response, while others, like sealed enclosures, can provide tighter, more controlled sound. Consider your preferences when evaluating enclosure types.
* **Imaging and Soundstage**: Good imaging and soundstage ensure an accurate spatial representation of the sound, which is particularly important for near-field listening. Look for speakers with detailed and precise imaging to create an immersive listening experience.
* **Reviews and Personal Taste**: Reading professional and user reviews can give insights into a speaker's performance and whether it matches your preferences. Remember that personal taste plays a significant role in the ideal speaker choice, so auditioning speakers when possible is highly recommended.
