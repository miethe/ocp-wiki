## Inclusion in Finance Reading Lists

If you've read the post on *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*, you probably came across my note on Dave Ramsey's book *The Total Money Makeover*. I would be among the last to recommend Dave Ramsey to a stranger on the street, so including any of his books caused me to take a moment of pause and reflection.

Dave Ramsey was included in the list because he is a popular personal finance author and radio host, and his book "The Total Money Makeover" has helped many people improve their financial situations. While his teachings might not be universally endorsed, they have been successful for a significant number of readers, particularly those dealing with debt and looking for a structured approach to managing their finances.

It is important to note that personal finance advice may not always align with specific political or ideological viewpoints. Some people may disagree with Dave Ramsey's approach or find it too conservative, while others appreciate his focus on debt reduction, living within one's means, and financial discipline.

It is also worth mentioning that personal finance is not a one-size-fits-all domain. Different people may benefit from various approaches depending on their financial situations and goals. While some of Ramsey's teachings might not resonate with progressives or liberals, other aspects, such as his emphasis on budgeting and avoiding debt, may still be helpful and relevant to a wide range of individuals.

When evaluating personal finance advice, it is crucial to consider the specific recommendations and strategies presented, rather than focusing solely on the author's political or ideological beliefs. Always be open to learning from different sources and adapting the advice to your unique financial situation and goals.
