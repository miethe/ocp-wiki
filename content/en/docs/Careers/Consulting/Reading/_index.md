## Intro

In this list you will find a collection of books, periodicals, and other writings which share one foundational trait: they help create incredible consultants. Consultants not only must be experts in their technical field, but should also be experts with people and businesses.

In order to foster that degree of expertise, it is important to expand your understanding in a variety of domains, from Business and Finance, to Communication and Influence, to Human Psychology and beyond!
